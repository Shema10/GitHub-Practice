Configured git
Created a folder on my destop
Used a git init . command to initialize this folder as git repository 
Created a file README.md in that folder 
Added this list into that file
---ADDED AFTER 1st COMMIT---
After this used “git add README.md” to add  the file to staging area
Used  “git rm —cached README.md” to remove the file from the staging area
Used “git add . “ to add the file again this command adds everything from this directory to the staging area
Used “git commit -m "git internship task” “ to basically create a save  point for this file
Used “git log “  to get the info about the commit
Used “git show (hash code)” to check the actual changes
