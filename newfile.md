Created an empty GitHub repository
Used git remote add origin https://github.com/KerimIm/GitHub-Practice.git to connect to the repo
Used git branch -M main to switch to main branch
Used git push to push my README.md file to the repo
Added a new file
Edited this file on the GitHub to make use of pull command
Used a “git pull” command to bring the changes from Github to my machine
Added some changes
Now I'm going to commit these new changes and push everyting and after this I will make a branch and work there
