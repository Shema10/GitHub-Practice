Created a branch named feature-a using command “git branch feature-a”
Used command “git checkout feature-a” to switch to a new branch,( to switch back to previous branch I used “git checkout -“

—-On the new branch—-
Created a new file named branchFile.txt on the branch feature-a
Added some text to it to describe what I did
